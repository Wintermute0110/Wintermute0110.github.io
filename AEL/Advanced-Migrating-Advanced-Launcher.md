Advanced Emulator Launcher supports importing Advanced Launcher `launchers.xml`.

 1. Open AEL settings, go to `Advanced` tab, then click on ``
 
 2. AEL will detect if you have AL installed and begin the importing process.

    Depending on the total number of ROMs you have in your launchres.xml the importing may take some time.

 3. You are done!
 
Once you have imported your ROMs into AEL you can safely edit your ROMs metadata in AEL. Metadata changes
in AEL will not affect metadata in AL. However, if you change your artwork (thumb/fanart) usually that
will affect both AEL and AL.

You can import you launchers.xml more than once. However, keep in mind that importing launchers.xml more than once will
overwrite your previously imported Advanced Launcher categories/launcher/ROMs.

**IMPORTANT** The `platform` of all imported launchers will be set to `Unknown`. You can later edit your launcher's
platform using the `Edit Launcher` context menu.
