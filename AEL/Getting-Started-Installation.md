## Things you need ##

 * A running [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) installation. AEL has been developed in [Kodibuntu](http://kodi.wiki/view/Kodibuntu)
   but has been tested and should run on any platform Kodi supports.
   
 * One or several emulators. Emulators must be already configured and you should be familiar with the command
   line parameters required to run them before using AEL.

 * Of course, some ROMs of your favourite systems.
 
 * You can also launch standalone applications which do not require ROMs or extra files.
 
## Installation from GitHub ##

 1. **Download the plugin** Go to AEL Github [main page](https://github.com/Wintermute0110/plugin.program.advanced.emulator.launcher).
    Then click on `Clone or download` button, then `Download ZIP`. This will download a ZIP file named
    `plugin.program.advanced.emulator.launcher-master.zip`.

 2. **Decompress the ZIP file** using your favourite ZIP utility. A new directory `plugin.program.advanced.emulator.launcher-master`
    will be created.
 
 3. **Rename** the directory from `plugin.program.advanced.emulator.launcher-master` to `plugin.program.advanced.emulator.launcher`.
 
 4. **Compress** `plugin.program.advanced.emulator.launcher` into `plugin.program.advanced.emulator.launcher.zip`.

 5. **Install in Kodi** Open Kodi. Go to `System` -- `Add-ons` -- `Install from zip file`. A file selector 
    dialog opens. Browse your files and select the ZIP file `plugin.program.advanced.emulator.launcher.zip`.
    
 6. You are done!
 
## Updating the plugin ##

From time to time newer versions of the plugin will be released. To update AEL just follow the steps
of the previous section.
