[color=#708090][b]Advanced MAME Launcher or Advanced Emulator Launcher?[/b][/color]

Why two different addons capable of launching MAME? Should I use [url=http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=304186]Advanced MAME Launcher[/url] or [url=http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826]Advanced Emulator Launcher[/url]?

[list]
[*]AML is much easier to configure than AEL. AEL is a general launcher whereas AML is tailored specifically for MAME.
[*]AEL only shows the MAME ROMs you have. As opposed, AML shows every single MAME machine, even the ones you don't have the ROMs for.
[*]AML includes a set of powerful Machine/ROM filters that makes navigation of MAME and Software Lists easy and convenient.
[/list]

The answer is that you can use both! AML and AEL have been designed to work in tandem to enrich the retrogaming experience for Kodi users.

[size=large][b][color=#6b8e23]Installation & Downloads[/color][/b][/size]

AML is now available on the [b]Kodi Official Addon Repository[/b]. To install it, go to [b]Settings[/b] and then to [b]Addon settings[/b], [b]Install from repository[/b]. AML is under the category [b]Program add-ons[/b] and [b]Game add-ons, Game providers[/b].

[b]NOTE[/b] If you are upgrading to AML 0.9.9 from a previous version make sure you read the Release Notes first! The Release Notes links are in the third post of this thread.

[size=small]Development builds are also available from GitHub by clicking [url=https://github.com/Wintermute0110/plugin.program.AML.dev]HERE.[/url] You can have both the stable version and the development version installed on the same machine. They behave like different addons and do not inferfere with each other.[/size]

[color=#708090][b]Setting up MAME ROMs, CHDs and assets[/b][/color]

If you need help setting up MAME in Linux or Windows you have a some good tutorials [url=http://easyemu.mameworld.info/mameguide/mameguide.html]here[/url], [url=http://www.mameguide.info/index.html]here[/url] and [url=http://choccyhobnob.com/articles/demystifying-mame-roms/]here[/url]. You can also ask questions about how to setup MAME in this thread but [i]please[/i] try to read the tutorials first in order not to ask the same basic questions again and again.

Supported [url=http://docs.mamedev.org/usingmame/aboutromsets.html]MAME ROM sets[/url]: AML currently supports [b]Merged[/b], [b]Split[/b], and [b]Fully Non-Merged[/b].

This is the recommended MAME directory layout. You have to create all the directories yourself, AML does not create any directory automatically.
[code]/home/kodi/AML-ROMs/                --> Place MAME arcade ROMs and BIOSes here
/home/kodi/AML-assets/              --> Place MAME and Software Lists assets here
/home/kodi/AML-CHDs/                --> Place the CHDs here
/home/kodi/AML-SL-ROMs/             --> Place the Software Lists ROMs here
/home/kodi/AML-SL-CHDs/             --> Place the Software Lists CHDs here
/home/kodi/AML-assets/samples/      --> MAME samples (optional)
/home/kodi/AML-assets/catver.ini    --> Catver (optional)
/home/kodi/AML-assets/catlist.ini   --> Catlist (optional)
/home/kodi/AML-assets/genre.ini     --> Genre (optional)

Catver.ini, Catlist.ini, Genre.ini, NPlayers.ini, Bestgames.ini and Series.ini are optional but recommended.

[list]
[*]If you configure Catver.ini then filter [i]Machines by Category (Catver)[/i] becomes available. You can download catver.ini [url=http://www.progettosnaps.net/catver/]from progretto-SNAPS[/url].
[*]If you configure Catlist.ini then filter [i]Machines by Category (Catlist)[/i] becomes available. You can download catver.ini [url=http://www.progettosnaps.net/catver/]from progretto-SNAPS[/url].

[/list]

AML 0.9.4 supports History.dat, MAMEInfo.dat, Gameinit.dat and Command.dat. All these files are optional.

[list]
[*]You can download History.dat [url=https://www.arcade-history.com/?page=download]from Arcade History[/url].
[*]You can download MAMEInfo.dat [url=http://mameinfo.mameworld.info/]from MASH's MAMEINFO[/url].

[*]You can download Command.dat [url=http://www.progettosnaps.net/command/]from progretto-SNAPS[/url].
[/list]

[b]Software Lists hash path[/b] is a subdirectory inside the MAME installation directory which contains the Software Lists XML databases.
 
[list]
[*][i]Linux users[/i] in Debian/Ubuntu it is typically located in [b][i]/usr/share/games/mame/hash/[/i][/b].
[*][i]Windows users[/i] if you installed MAME in [b][i]E:\MAME[/i][/b] then the [b]Software Lists hash path[/b] would be located in [b][i]E:\MAME\hash\[/i][/b].
[/list]

The Software Lists ROMs/CHDs must be in a subdirectory whose name must match each Software List name, like in the following example:
[code]/home/kodi/AML-SL-ROMs/32x/game_1.zip      --> ROMs for 32x Software List
/home/kodi/AML-SL-ROMs/32x/game_2.zip      
...
/home/kodi/AML-SL-ROMs/megadriv/game_1.zip --> ROMs for megadriv Software List
/home/kodi/AML-SL-ROMs/megadriv/game_2.zip
...[/code]

Remember to update your [i]mame.ini[/i] configuration file to point to the correct directories where you have placed your ROMs/CHDs. Otherwise MAME won't work at all.

[color=#708090][b]Setting up MAME assets and Software List assets[/b][/color]

Place MAME assets/artwork in the following directories:

[code]/home/kodi/AML-assets/artpreviews/   --> MAME artpreview PNG files
/home/kodi/AML-assets/artwork/       --> MAME artwork ZIP files
/home/kodi/AML-assets/cabinets/      --> MAME cabinets
/home/kodi/AML-assets/clearlogos/    --> MAME clearlogos/wheels
/home/kodi/AML-assets/covers_SL/     --> Software Lists covers/boxfronts
/home/kodi/AML-assets/cpanels/       --> MAME control panels
/home/kodi/AML-assets/fanarts/       --> AML will create MAME Fanarts here
/home/kodi/AML-assets/fanarts_SL/    --> AML will create SL Fanarts here
/home/kodi/AML-assets/flyers/        --> MAME flyers
/home/kodi/AML-assets/manuals/       --> MAME machine PDF/CBZ/CBR manuals
/home/kodi/AML-assets/manuals_SL/    --> SL items PDF/CBZ/CBR manuals
/home/kodi/AML-assets/marquees/      --> MAME marquees
/home/kodi/AML-assets/PCBs/          --> MAME PCBs
/home/kodi/AML-assets/samples/       --> MAME Sample ZIP files
/home/kodi/AML-assets/snaps/         --> MAME in-game screenshots
/home/kodi/AML-assets/snaps_SL/      --> Software Lists in-game screenshots
/home/kodi/AML-assets/titles/        --> MAME title screenshots
/home/kodi/AML-assets/titles_SL/     --> Software Lists in-game screenshots
/home/kodi/AML-assets/videosnaps/    --> MAME trailers (MP4 format)
/home/kodi/AML-assets/videosnaps_SL/ --> Software Lists trailers (MP4 format)
[/code]

When configuring AML, [b]MAME assets path[/b] in this example would be [b][i]/home/kodi/AML-assets/[/i][/b].

MAME machines have a broad range of assets, including Cabinets, Clearlogos, Control Panels, Flyers, PCBs, in-game snaps and title screenshots. Software Lists, however, only have Covers/Boxfronts, in-game snaps and title screenshots. The covers, snaps and titles of each software list must be in their own subdirectory like in this example:

[code]/home/kodi/AML-assets/covers_SL/32x/       --> Covers for 32x Software List
/home/kodi/AML-assets/covers_SL/megadriv/  --> Covers for megadriv Software List
...
/home/kodi/AML-assets/snaps_SL/32x/        --> Snaps for 32x Software List
/home/kodi/AML-assets/snaps_SL/megadriv/   --> Snaps for megadriv Software List
...[/code]

Note that the Software List artwork collections ZIP or Torrent files follow this naming scheme so you only have to decompress or copy the ZIP file/torrent in the appropiate directory.

AML doesn't have (and [i]never[/i] will have) asset/artwork scrapers. You can however download full MAME artwork collections from here:

[color=#708090][b]Setting up Advanced MAME Launcher (Easy mode)[/b][/color]

1) Install and run AML for the first time.

2) Open AML settings, in the tab Paths configure the [b]MAME executable[/b] and the [b]ROMs path[/b].

3) (Optional) Configure the [b]MAME assets path[/b], [b]MAME CHDs path[/b], [b]Software Lists hash path[/b], [b]Software Lists ROMs path[/b], [b]Software Lists CHDs path[/b], [b]Samples path[/b], [b]Catver.ini path[/b], [b]Catlist.ini path[/b], [b]Genre.ini path[/b], [b]nplayers.ini[/b], [b]bestgames.ini[/b], [b]series.ini[/b].

4) In AML root window select any item, open the context menu, select "Setup plugin". Execute, in consecutive order:

4.1) [b]Extract MAME.xml ...[/b] extracts the MAME.xml database from MAME.

4.2) [b]Build all databases[/b] converts the MAME XML database into JSON format, strips out unneeded information to boost performance, generates the filter parent/clone lists and processes the Software List XML databases.

4.3) [b]Scan everyting[/b] scans your MAME machine ROMs, CHDs and Samples, Software Lists ROMs and CHDs, and MAME machines and Software Lists assets/artwork. Sets all tags having a [b]?[/b] to the appropriate value.

If everything is OK you are now able to navigate all MAME ROMs (arcade/computer machines and Software Lists).

[color=#708090][b]Setting up Advanced MAME Launcher (Advanced mode)[/b][/color]

The [b]Setup plugin[/b], [b]Step by step ...[/b] menu allows you to execute the AML database setup process step by step, as opposed to automatically. For example, if you install/copy new MAME assets you can execute "Scan MAME assets/artwork ..." to bring the MAME machine artwork database up-to-date. Alternatively, you can run [b]Scan everyting[/b] to bring all ROMs/assets databases up-to-date but it will take much longer.
