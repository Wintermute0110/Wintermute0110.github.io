[size=x-large]New AML release 0.9.3[/size]

The main feature of this release is the speed: the browsing is now much faster than before thanks to a redesigned ROM database. Many other things have been improved here and there, particularly launching of Software List ROMs. There is a new "Parents only" view mode that launches machines from a parent view (clones can be accessed from the context menu "Show clones"). Also, there are new MAME Favourite machines and Software Lists Favourite ROMs sections to store your treasured machine/ROMs!

[b]NOTE[/b] AML is still under heavy development and the format of the databases may change in the future. Do not make huge lists of Favourites because there could be incompatibilities with future versions (in other words, it may be possible that you will need to wipe out your favourites in order to upgrade AML).

The instructions on the first and second post need and update to follow up with 0.9.3 version but you should be able to figure out the new menus and settings :;):

In order to not to accumulate cruft, it is recommended that [b]before[/b] you upgrade to AML 0.9.3 you delete the PLUGIN_DATA_DIRECTORY. On Linux is is located in:
[code]/home/your_username/.kodi/userdata/addon_data/plugin.program.advanced.MAME.launcher[/code]

On Windows
[code]C:\Users\your_username\AppData\Roaming\Kodi\userdata\addon_data\plugin.program.advanced.MAME.launcher[/code]

After deleting the directory then install AML using the ZIP file. You will need to configure the plugin (MAME executable and paths), rebuild the databases and scan for ROMs/assets again.
