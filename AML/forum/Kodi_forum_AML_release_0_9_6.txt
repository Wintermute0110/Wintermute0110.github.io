[size=x-large]New AML release 0.9.6[/size]

New AML release! Compared with previous releases 0.9.6 does not introduce big changes. The main feature is support for Most Played and Recently played MAME machines and Software List items. Parents with kids will be happy to hear that support for [inline]Mature.ini[/inline] has been added and now Mature MAME machines can be completely filtered out. Mature.ini is included in the ZIP file that contains Catver.ini. Finally, the usability of AML has been improved. Now, if the database is not built AML will print a message telling the user what to do, etc., which I think will be great for new users of the addon.

If everything is all right and nobody reports any serious issue I will include AML 0.9.6 in the official Kodi repo. The policy for new releases will be to update AML on the forum first and about one week later update the Kodi repository. From now on, AML will keep you Favourite machines, Recently Played and Most Played machines (no need for more database wipe outs) between upgrades.

[size=large][color=#0020ff]Upgrading AML to release 0.9.6[/color][/size]

1) Install AML 0.9.6 using the ZIP file.

2) Follow the steps of Extracting MAME XML, Build all databases and Scan everything and build plots. Extracting MAME XML resets the ROM audit statistics so if you want to see those you also need to repead the ROM audit.

3) Open AML settings, go to the "I/O" tab and click on "Check/Update all objects". This will bring your MAME Favourites, MAME Most Played, etc. up to date with the last version of the database.
